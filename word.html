            <b>Meditating on God's Wonderful Decrees</b><br><br>
            A
            Scripture Reading — <text style="color: green">Psalm 119:25-32</text><br>

            Cause me to understand the way of your precepts, that I may meditate on your wonderful deeds. — Psalm 119:27

            You’ve probably noticed that the psalmist uses several words to describe God’s law. The writer of Psalm 119
            uses “law,” “ways,” “decrees,” “precepts,” “statutes,” “commands,” and “word” to refer to the same thing. At
            first glance, the legal associations of these terms might make God’s Word seem like a heavy set of do’s and
            don’ts weighing on all our actions.

            But that’s not how the psalmist views God’s Word. In this prayer for deeper understanding of God’s precepts,
            the psalmist connects God’s Word with God’s “wonderful deeds.” Specifically, the psalmist may be thinking of
            God’s “mighty hand and . . . outstretched arm” in freeing Israel from slavery in Egypt and bringing them
            into the promised land (Deuteronomy 26:8-9). Generally, the psalmist is referring to all of God’s mighty
            deeds on behalf of his people throughout history.<br><br>

            It’s obvious that in meditating on God’s Word the psalmist isn’t taking on a heavy yoke of shoulds and
            should nots. Rather, God’s Word crowds his mind with memories of God’s faithfulness to his people and to the
            psalmist personally.

            That’s what God’s Word does for us too. It teaches us about God’s deep love for us and his power to save us.
            Such knowledge allows God’s Word to work in our hearts to increase our love for him and to nourish our
            desire to serve him in gratitude.

            Prayer

            Lord, help us to choose the way of faithfulness, and set our hearts on your Word. Amen.
